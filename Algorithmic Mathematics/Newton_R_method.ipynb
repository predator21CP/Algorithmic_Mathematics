    "The SymPy library, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, offers the function sp.lambdify. It transforms SymPy expressions into callable functions that may be quantitatively evaluated. The lambdify function takes one or more SymPy expressions and creates a lambda function that represents the mathematical expression. \n",

    "The SymPy expression that you wish to turn into a callable function is the expression argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The external modules to be utilized are specified by the modules argument, which is an optional parameter. It employs 'numpy' by default, enabling the lambda function to effectively utilise NumPy arrays. If more modules are required, you may additionally specify'math' or'mpmath'.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use sp.lambdify to turn SymPy expressions into lambda functions, it generates a function that uses the underlying numerical libraries, such NumPy or math, to carry out the mathematical operations indicated in the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the required input variables and the provided expression, lambdify generates a lambda function that carries out the necessary mathematical operations. To handle operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and other mathematical functions, it makes use of the numerical libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sp.lambdify examines the SymPy expression from the inside out and produces the matching numerical code. The lambda function that may effectively evaluate the expression is then created using the external module that has been supplied (for example, NumPy).\n",
    "For example, if you have an expression like x^2 + sp.sin(y), the lambda function generated by lambdify would use the appropriate mathematical operations and functions from the chosen module (e.g., NumPy) to perform the addition, exponentiation, and sine calculation for the given input values of x and y.\n",

    "### sp.diff()\n",
    "Differentiation is carried out via the SymPy sp.diff function using a mix of symbolic manipulation and pattern matching techniques. Depending on the structure of the phrase being discriminated, a specific algorithm may be utilized. SymPy uses a range of approaches to handle various expression types and apply the proper differentiation rules.\n",
    "The differentiation algorithm in SymPy employs a recursive method that applies differentiation rules based on the expression's structure. The algorithm's main characteristics are as follows:\n",

    "**Matching patterns to pinpoint certain forms or subexpressions inside the provided expression, SymPy use pattern matching algorithms. It searches for patterns that adhere to established differentiation principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expression Transformation: After a pattern is matched, SymPy applies predefined rules to transform the expression. The power rule, product rule, chain rule, and other rules are based on the mathematical characteristics of differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symbolic Manipulation: During the differentiation process, SymPy uses symbolic manipulation techniques to simplify the equation and apply algebraic principles. By merging related terms, performing algebraic operations, and removing common components, it simplifies the final statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Differentiation: SymPy iteratively performs the differentiation algorithm to each subexpression or function in an expression that has many subexpressions or functions. The ability to handle complicated expressions containing nested functions or composite functions is a result of this.\n"
